### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my Github! I'm Zhe Ming but I also go by Ming. I'm currently a sophomore Computer Science major at Georgia Tech and had previous internships (including one at TikTok!) working on robotics, computer vision, and machine learning

ðŸ”­ I am currently doing research with Prof. Thad Starner, building symbiotic artificial intelligence systems that can learn from users as they go about their normal tasks

ðŸŒ± I'm always interested to learn more about computer science, particularly machine learning and computer vision

ðŸ“« Email me at zchng3@gatech.edu or chngzm@gmail.com

âš¡ Fun fact: I used to build remote-controlled planes, my profile picture is one of my favorite ones during a test flight
