# Hi there 👋

Welcome to my Github! I'm Zhe Ming but I also go by Ming. I'm currently a junior Computer Science major at Georgia Tech and have completed previous internships working on robotics, computer vision, and machine learning (including one at TikTok and Meta AI!). 

## About Me

🔭 I am currently doing research with Prof. Thad Starner, building symbiotic artificial intelligence systems that can learn from users as they go about their normal tasks

✍🏻 In my free time, I write over Machine Learning Mastery, check out some of my articles <a href="https://machinelearningmastery.com/author/chngzm/">here</a>

🌱 I'm always interested to learn more about software development, computer science, and machine learning

📫 Email me at zchng3@gatech.edu or chngzm@gmail.com

⚡ Fun fact: I used to build remote-controlled planes, my profile picture is one of my favorite ones during a test flight
